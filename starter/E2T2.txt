Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

## 1 

![Brute forced](e2t2-1.png)

From the screenshot we can see that because we allow SSH connection, it is vulnerable to Brute forced attack.
What we can do is:
    - Using Bastion host in front. So that the web server is not SSH accessable by public.
    - Disable password authentication for the instance so no ssh session is allowed using a password.


## 2

![Security Group](e2t2-2.png)

Because EC2 is in public subnet, which is public accessible.
What we can do is:
    - Put EC2 into private subnet.
    - Modify EC2 SG only allow ALB's SG
    - Not assign public IP address

## 3

S3 buckets should have server-side encyprtion enabled by default.
