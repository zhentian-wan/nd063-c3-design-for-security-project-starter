# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack

# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.

[How do I use GuardDuty to identify SSH brute force attacks on Linux instances?](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/identify-attacks-with-guardduty/)


From the Actor section

Can know the attacker IP address: `10.192.11.230`.

"To detect unauthorized and unexpected activity in your AWS environment, GuardDuty analyzes and processes 
data from AWS CloudTrail event logs, VPC Flow Logs, and DNS logs to detect anomalies involving the following AWS 
resource types: IAM Access Keys, EC2 Instances, and S3 Bucket", ref: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty_data-sources.html#guardduty_vpc

Hence guardduty is an AWS service that basically uses or analyze data from other AWS logging service to interpret the logs and present
any vulnerabilities in a more clear or readable way to users. If we further read the documentation, VPC flow logs is described as

"VPC Flow Logs capture information about the IP traffic going to and from Amazon EC2 network interfaces in your VPC"

Hence any SSH access such as the brute force must be detected and analyze by AWS GuardDuty from this data source.
