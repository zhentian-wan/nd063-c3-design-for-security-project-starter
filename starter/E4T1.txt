# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.

1. Create a bastion host, only allow SSH from bastion host.
2. Put EC2 instance of Web server into private subnet, modify SG only allow HTTP from ALB.
3. Deattch EIP from Web server instance, so not public accessible

# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.
1. The IAM role for EC2 instance should only be able to access free recipes bucket. Not to all S3 bucekts.
2. Secret bucekt policy should only allow priveleged busniess user IAM Role for read & write
